# Tutorial: Password_strength-analyzer_project

This project is a **Password Strength Analyzer** that helps users understand how secure their passwords are by checking them and providing helpful *feedback*. It also includes a tool to *generate* customized lists of potential passwords based on personal information, which can then be *saved* to a file for various security testing purposes. The application offers both an *easy-to-use graphical interface* and a powerful *command-line interface* for flexibility.
